## [1.3.1] - 2025-12-30
### 🔧 Improvements
- **Better Inputs Handling**: `publish` now better handles default values.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-29
### ✨ Features
- **Smart Legacy Migration**: Now strictly checks `build.gradle` to identify the exact custom `key.properties` file and variable names used (`keyAlias`, `storeFile`, etc.) when migrating legacy setups, ensuring your existing build configuration remains untouched.
- **Improved Sign UX**: Better prompts for saving legacy configurations and clearer visual feedback when creating or overwriting profiles.
- **Version Preservation**: Each configuration profile now remembers its own app version (from `pubspec.yaml`), automatically restoring it when you switch profiles. Perfect for managing different versions for dev/staging/prod.
- **Dynamic Property Preservation**: Any extra properties in your `key.properties` file (e.g. API keys) are now preserved and restored safely.

### 🔧 Improvements
- **Robust Parsing**: `publish config` now better handles custom Gradle configurations during migration.

## [1.2.5] - 2025-12-29
### ✨ Features
- **Multi-Config System**: Manage multiple app profiles (dev, staging, prod) with unique settings.
- **Asset Preservation**: Android/iOS icons and splash screens are now backed up and restored automatically when switching configurations.
- **New Commands**: 
  - `publish config`: Full suite for managing configs (`list`, `switch`, `delete`, `rename`, `edit`, `export`, `import`).
  - `publish set`: Quickly update app name or ID (renamed from old `config` command).
- **Build Integration**: Added `--config` flag to `build android` to temporarily build with a specific profile.
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Support for `versionSuffix` (e.g., -beta) and `splashColor` in profiles.

### 🔧 Improvements
- Renamed `write config` command to `set` to avoid conflicts.
- significantly improved documentation and README.## [1.2.4] - 2025-12-25
